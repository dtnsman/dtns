dtns.network 

dtns.network is a kind of intelligent-body-world (equal to open-world、opensource AI/agent hub) software，main writen by javascript , can run on browser and node.js 、 deno 、electron，it is a cross platform end to end software, support linux、mac、windows、android、ios、openharmony etc.

dtns.network base on dnalink. the dnalink is a decentralized software component same as blockchain. Dnalink powered by POP（proof of public-releation, mean it’s safeful base on the data-struct which same as dna struct, have to write a operation to two main chain ）, the relation of two chain and their parent chains and parent parent chains, construct the POP mechanism.

Dtns.network is safety and powerfully, simply to use! The program language which name poplang is writen for dtns.network. base on poplang and it's software component, every one can use it to build private or public hub of intelligent-body-world--IB3.hub--the hub of opensource ai/robot/agent , help you to be superman!

dtns.network allow every one use the dtns.connector to connect to ib3.hub and dtns.network. dtns.connector is simply and powerfully client. Let people write poplang program by dtns.creator、dtns.3d.creator、ibchat. It have pop-devtools ,which is commonly same as the chrome-tools, allow poplang programer can create dtns.plugin 、xcard lite-app easily.

dtns.connector also have many powerful components:

1、dweb，post micro-content to community

2、Im，the p2p chat and groupchat，suport emoji、text、image、video-audio chat content，e2ee network!

3、dfolder, save your private or public files、folders

4、forklist, provide the nft-token-shopping mall

5、wallet, the dnalink’s wallet client

6、mini-shopping-mall、forkpay: the software component to provide pay service

7、dtns.plugin:write by vue-js、poplang

8、dtns.creator、dtns.3d.creator

9、dtns.bakdb:backup the dtns.network and ib3.hub data

10、dtns-manager: dtns:// protocol client to connect all kind of ib3.hub, help agent use the service of ib3.hub same as http protocol easily!

The dtns.connector：the client of dtns.network, base on p2p protocol，powered by webrtc, allow people to build their private or public ib3.hub or opensource agent hub, can run on js-runtime , as web-browser、nodejs、deno、electron, and support many kinds of OS: windows、linux、mac、android、openharmony。

the pop-network, or name the dnalink. here simple api to operate the dnalink like this:

opcode token_x token_y opval extra_data

opcode suported:

1、fork: fork the child token chain from parent token chain

2、send: send the msg or money

3、assert: assert the data into chain

4、relate: save relation of token_x and token_y

5、rela-relz: 26 relation opcodes provide to programer 

6、etc.

opval allow max than 10kb text or json data write to dnalink!
extra_data allow your other information write on the chain ,one case as shopping order-id etc.

POP let dnalkink being kvdb and ORD data storage and dna-like-app super-ecosystem! it is very faster and auto expand system, make dtns.network being stronge decentralized system!

Build on the simply opcode system--also name poplang（program language on opcode system, POP is the proof of public relations），make ib3.hub easy to build 、to use 、 to synchronised data、to construct safety and powerfully intelligent Parallel universes!

poplang means: you can easily make your software or hardware being intelligent! it is powerfully ecosystem to help every one to build ib3.hub!

To build the ib3.hub, we also have some dtns.plugin examples:

1、rt-market

2、rt-standard-market

3、rt-channel

4、rt-msgbottle

5、rt-code

6、rt-shopping

7、rt-chess

8、rt-audioroom

9、rt-videoroom

10、api-monitor

11、dxib-application

dtns.network create DID-system、dtns protocol、forkpay fintech system、dnalink（kvdb and ORD data storage and dna-app system） to make ib3.hub simply and usefully. Allow ib3.hub can connect to each other, and help each other, just like three-body-world.

Now, use dtns.network and ib3.hub, make you have the power of the ib3-world!
